# No-show-Appointments-Analysis
The dataset comprises information from 100,000 medical appointments and focuses on the key question of whether patients attend their scheduled appointments. My research highlighted the importance of further investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing attendance. I recommended strategies such as sending reminders to patients about upcoming appointments, providing transportation assistance to healthcare facilities, and fostering improved communication between patients and healthcare providers. These efforts aim to address the complex interactions between personal, systemic, and financial barriers (including access to scholarships) that affect appointment adherence.
